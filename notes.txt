How to check if feed has changed:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1326398/detecting-new-new-items-in-a-rss-feed


TODO:

*Add ability to check if add .rss to end of url works in url is invalid

*Import Export to/from OPML

*Remove unecessary headers and post attributes

*Don't allow duplicate subscriptions

*Don't allow similar duplicates ie https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/.rss vs https://www.reddit.com/r/cats.rss

*Limit the number of request to prevent getting rate limited (429)

*strip white space off of urls

*sometimes queries are made before the tables are finished creating (actually was only happening when requiring file that queries db before creating db)

*Set timeout for requesting feed url if it takes too long

*capatalization in url. Same url but it is seen as a different one

*currently only inserting posts if there is no identifier conflict between every posts
	maybe change this to only if there is an identifier conflict with posts from same feed

*subscribe to 2 of the same feeds but with case differenses in url:
	before: Second feed posts weren't populating due to conflicts
	make sure conflicts don't happen between different feeds

*Where should I put data being stored on the frontend? attach to the element? Or global variable?

*Currently any data in the button data propery is erased when the subscribtions are re rendered

*unsubscribing from feed currently doesn't remove all posts from that feed
    either remove feed and all posts or neither
	
*When no feed is selected (none have active class) error occurs when refreshing feeds (adding new feed)

*JSON version of reddit feeds might have upvotes
	ex. http://www.reddit.com/r/inthemorning/.json

*cors

*make sure no route handlers can crash server

*infinite scrolling will fetch feeds twice initially for some reason. Might be due the last feed being visible and a race condition with the loading flag

*If it takes 12 minutes to update all feeds and feeds update every 10 minutes that will be an issue

*Delete posts after a certain date so the database doesn't grow too large

* When adding favorites to posts make sure not to delete posts that are favorited

*Prop drilling seems to be getting excessive. Look into contexts or redux (or react query)

*Add ability for feed to be in multiple folders

*Ordering of feeds and folders aren't preserved when fetching from db

*Feeds aren't being deleted when unsubscribing

* Received error:
	TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'feedid')
    at Object.getFeedId (/home/ariab/RSSReader/server/db/queries/feedQueries.js:11:24)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
    at async getFeed (/home/ariab/RSSReader/server/controllers/feedController.js:12:24)

	Maybe make sure that when getting feedId, if subscriptionid doesn't exists handle that somehow
	
* change sidebar color to chatgpt sidebar color

* posts don't get updated when adding subscription (Make it so the added subscription is selected)
