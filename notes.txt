https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1326398/detecting-new-new-items-in-a-rss-feed


TODO:

*Add ability to check if add .rss to end of url works in url is invalid

*Import Export to/from OPML

*Remove unecessary headers and post attributes

*Don't allow duplicate subscriptions

*Don't allow similar duplicates ie https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/.rss vs https://www.reddit.com/r/cats.rss

*Limit the number of request to prevent getting rate limited (429)

*strip white space off of urls

*sometimes queries are made before the tables are finished creating (actually was only happening when requiring file that queries db before creating db)

*Set timeout for requesting feed url if it takes too long

*capatalization in url. Same url but it is seen as a different one

*currently only inserting posts if there is no identifier conflict between every posts
	maybe change this to only if there is an identifier conflict with posts from same feed

*subscribe to 2 of the same feeds but with case differenses in url:
	before: Second feed posts weren't populating due to conflicts
	make sure conflicts don't happen between different feeds

*Where should I put data being stored on the frontend? attach to the element? Or global variable?

*Currently any data in the button data propery is erased when the subscribtions are re rendered

*unsubscribing from feed currently doesn't remove all posts from that feed
    either remove feed and all posts or neither
